# TwoLevelCoarseCorrect

Julia implementation of a state of the art, two level sparse graph correction algorithm. For
use with sparse un-directed graphs commonly found in social networks, with desirable
convergence, error and sparsity preserving properties. Applications include graph
partitioning, clustering and community detection where the original sparse graph is too large
to work with directly.
